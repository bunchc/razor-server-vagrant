razor-server-vagrant
====================

Vagrant up razor-server found here: https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server

More proper description is here: http://anystacker.com/2014/01/vagrant-up-razor-server/

Installs razor-server, razor-client, and all the other bits. Downloads ubuntu image, creates policy, and is ready to boot a brand new VM.

Be warned that installing all the things plus downloading an additional image can take a really long time, depending on your network and machine. 

Once the vagrant VM is created and finished, attach new VM to the network that was created and watch it boot.

Been tested with Fusion, not so much with VirtualBox. Testing takes a bit long, so feel free to submit patches.
